# FG-CLIP 2: A Bilingual Fine-grained Vision-language Alignment Model

This repository is the official implementation of FG-CLIP and FG-CLIP 2, a new generation of text-image cross-modal model excels in fine-grained discrimination and embedding.

FG-CLIP 2 is the foundation model for fine-grained vision-language understanding in both English and Chinese. 
Across 29 datasets and 8 diverse tasks, it consistently surpasses recent strong baselines such as SigLIP 2 and MetaCLIP 2, achieving the best reported performance to date in both languages.

<!-- ## Overview




Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. The key ingredients of FG-CLIP 2 are summarized below.

- Rich Fine-Grained Supervision. Including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions.
- Bilingual Multimodal Data. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance.
- Performance. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages.
- Chinese Multimodal Benchmark. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. -->

## Model Framework
Our approach employs a two-stage hierarchical learning framework that progressively enhances vision-language alignment from global semantics to fine-grained details.

Stage 1: Global Semantic Alignment. We begin with large-scale image-text pairs, each annotated with both a short caption (for concise scene-level description) and a long caption (for rich contextual detail). Training on this bilingual corpus enables strong global alignment, establishing a robust foundation for cross-modal understanding in both English and Chinese.

Stage 2: Fine-Grained Visual-Language Learning. Building upon the globally aligned representation, we add region-level supervision and multiple fine-grained objectives to sharpen local correspondences. Specifically, this stage incorporates:

- Fine-Grained Visual Learning: region‚Äìcaption alignment via RoIAlign-extracted region features and phrase-level descriptions.
- Fine-Grained Textual Learning: discrimination of subtle textual differences using hard negatives with perturbed attributes.
- Cross-Modal Rank Loss with Global Threshold Synchronization: dynamic margin-based ranking with globally synchronized thresholds for stable hard negative mining.
- Textual Intra-modal Contrastive Loss: intra-language contrastive learning to separate semantically similar but distinct region captions.

## Train

### Data Preparation

We provide code for the second stage training using the [ü§óFineHARD dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/qihoo360/FineHARD). FineHARD dataset includes 12 million images, 40 million bounding boxes with fine-grained region descriptions, and 10 million hard negative samples.
</br>
For data preparation, please refer to [Data: FineHARD](data/data.md)


### Ready for Training
Our training and inference code is completely based on the transformers repository provided by huggingface, which is a very easy to use and easy to reproduce. We have provided the training script in the scripts directory.
</br>
[ü§ó Transformers: State-of-the-art Machine Learning for Pytorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
</br>
Our training script supports the use of zero2, tf32 acceleration, and bf16 precision (note that fp16 precision may cause gradient NAN). If you do not meet the above conditions, please turn off tf32 and replace deepspeed startup with torchrun.
